This repository contains two main scripts. 

1 - A server application - This meant for a static computer that will allow the user to control the car/drone with an active video stream over the network. 

2 - A client applicaiton - This will operate on the cars single board computer and drive the motors and camera servos based on control input from the server side. 


The applicaiton is fairly rigid in network configuraiton as it is for experimentation. The end concept will be to replace the remote control inputs on the server side, with a neural network **
